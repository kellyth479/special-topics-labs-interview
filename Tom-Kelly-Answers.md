Q1: So you're finishing up your time in this CSCC program. Why did you decide to embark on this journey?

* *Tom:* I traveled to Ireland last October, It was beautiful. I met some distant relatives in Ballycroy, County Mayo.

Q4: Do you have any pets? Species/Name/Details please. Murray wants to know... (he's not as smart as that picture makes him seem).
* *Tom:* I have a cat, Little One. She likes to lie by the heater and paw at birds in the morning, as soon as they start chirping outside. Her favorite place to do so is the window at the head of my bed.
